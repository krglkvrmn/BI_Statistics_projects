# Survival analysis project

The project was carried out within the course **"Statistics and Data Analysis in R"** in Institute of Bioinformatics.

## Project description

In this project survival in a randomized trial comparing two treatments for ovarian cancer is analyzed ([ovarian data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/survival/html/ovarian.html) from package **survival**). 

**In the course of the mini-project following tasks were planned:**

- Describe data set and make EDA
- Make Kaplanâ€“Meier curves
- Estimate influence of different factor on survival rate
- Analyze hazard factors and estimate hazard ratios

Detailed workflow including R code can be found in **Report.rmd**.
