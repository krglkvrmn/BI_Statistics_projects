# Project #3 "Protein expression analysis"

The project was carried out within the course **"Statistics and Data Analysis in R"** in Institute of Bioinformatics.

## Project description

In this project protein expression data of mice is analyzed. 

The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. Mice are divided into 8 groups by treatment (injected with memantine/saline), genotype (Down syndrome/normal), behavior (stimulated to learn/control).

Detailed data set description as well as data itself can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression#).

Project objectives:

+ Describe data set
+ Discover are there any differences in protein production depending on mice group
+ Try to build a linear model that can predict the level of protein production based on data on other proteins
+ Perform PCA and interpret it's results
+ Find differential proteins

Detailed workflow including R code can be found in **Report.rmd**.
